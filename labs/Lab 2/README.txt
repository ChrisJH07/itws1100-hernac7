Lab 2 – HTML Resume Project

For Lab 2 in my ITWS class, I was tasked with creating a personal resume using HTML. 
At the beginning, I had very little knowledge about HTML tags, structure, or how webpages are built.

The process of learning and creating my resume was both challenging and fun. 
I started by learning the basics. Then, I practiced formatting my content and adding different sections.


I learned the importance of planning the layout before coding. 
Organizing my information clearly made the HTML easier to write and understand. 
I experimented with different tags and styles to improve the readability and presentation of my resume.

I plan to use these skills to create professional webpages, improve my online portfolio, 
and continue learning more advanced web development techniques.
